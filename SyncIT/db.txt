Moving the bookmark DB to Unicode
---------------------------------

1.  Add a codepage row to the person table.  This is NULL
    until the user logs in with the BookmarkSync v1.2 client,
    and invokes the post_login stored procedure.

2.  Implement the post_login stored procedure.
    This SP looks like the old motd/motd2 procedures,
    it takes two parameters, a person ID and a code page.
    it returns a possibly empty result set of commands
    that should be sent to the user.
    It returns 0 if the user should continue to get bookmarks,
    or non-zero if a *E error message should be sent down.

Now we wait.
